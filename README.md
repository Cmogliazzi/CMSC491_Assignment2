# CMSC491_Assignment2

In this assignment you will build a locationâ€“based app that alerts you through a Toast that you are within a 200m radius a specific place. For example, that place can be UMBC or that place could be a Walmart. Your app should take that as an input from the user. Your app should also have a Map interface that displays your present location, and the location of the place that the user has registered for notifications from. In case of a general retail store like Walmart, choose one Walmart closest to the present location of the user.
